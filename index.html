                        Ignacio Diaz is a Chilean Guy, 22 years old, who currently lives in Melbourne, Australia.
                        I have been insterested in technology since I was on primary school, when I used to ask myself
                        how computers teachers used would work. Since then, I have always been looking for information to answer my questions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first tech thing I did was on 2014, when at the age of 15 I built my first desktop PC.
                        I remember It took me the whole day but at the end It was worth the effort.
                        These are some of the reasons why on 2018 I decided to study Computer and Software Engineering at University.
                        On Python I coded some little softwares, I learnt basics of coding such as Arrys, Counters, Variables,
                        Sub-Programs among other basics.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The following year was even more exciting for me, I learnt Java, very popular programming language.
                        I must admit Java's syntax is harder compared to Python's, I had to read and watch a lot of tutorial to 
                        understand what I had to do.
                        After having understood basic syntax, I went through OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), which really blowed my mind.
                        However, It was one of the most useful tools I have learnt in coding.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fortunately or unfortunately, on 2019 I had to quit University to move to Australia, therefore I was not able
                        to continue studying. I have been working throughout my time in Australia, but not studying.
                        In August I joined Monash Boot Camp Spot to study Full Stack web development, where I have been gaining
                        knowledge to build this web site.
