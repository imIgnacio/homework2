# homework2

## Web page made by Ignacio Diaz, Full stack developer student.

This web page was created as part of homework for the course I am doing.

It is a portfolio to show other developers my skills and what I am able to create, code and design.

In the future I will be adding new projects, repositories and pages.

The web page has a header, where a navbar is located to find all links.
It also contains cards, where my projects are linked. And the footer whrere the contact me section is, including
email, phone, Linkedin and Github.
